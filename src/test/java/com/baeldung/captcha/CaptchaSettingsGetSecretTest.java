"""
Scenario 1: Validate getSecret method returns the correct secret value.

Details:
  TestName: validateCorrectSecretReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getSecret method correctly retrieves the secret value that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the CaptchaSettings class and use the setSecret method to set a known secret value.
  Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned secret value against the known secret value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method is correctly retrieving the secret value. The expected result is the known secret value that was set. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the getSecret method.

Scenario 2: Validate getSecret method returns null when no secret value is set.

Details:
  TestName: validateNullSecretReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getSecret method returns null when no secret value has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the CaptchaSettings class without setting a secret value.
  Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned secret value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method correctly handles the case where no secret value is set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capability.

Scenario 3: Validate getSecret method returns the last set secret value.

Details:
  TestName: validateLastSetSecretReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getSecret method returns the last set secret value when the setSecret method is called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the CaptchaSettings class and use the setSecret method to set multiple secret values.
  Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned secret value against the last secret value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method correctly retrieves the last set secret value. The expected result is the last secret value that was set. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to update and retrieve the latest secret value.

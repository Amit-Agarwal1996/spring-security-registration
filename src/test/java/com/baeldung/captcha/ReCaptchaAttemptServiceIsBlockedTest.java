"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of attempts
Details:
  TestName: testIsUserBlockedAfterMaxAttempts
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of attempts. We simulate a scenario where a user fails the reCaptcha multiple times until they reach the maximum limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a key for a user and fail the reCaptcha for that key MAX_ATTEMPT times.
  Act: Invoke the isBlocked method with the user's key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of attempts. The expected result is true because the user has failed the reCaptcha MAX_ATTEMPT times. This test is significant in preventing bot activities by limiting the number of reCaptcha attempts.
Scenario 2: Test to verify if the user is not blocked before reaching the maximum number of attempts
Details:
  TestName: testIsUserNotBlockedBeforeMaxAttempts
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user is not blocked before reaching the maximum number of attempts. We simulate a scenario where a user fails the reCaptcha fewer times than the maximum limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a key for a user and fail the reCaptcha for that key less than MAX_ATTEMPT times.
  Act: Invoke the isBlocked method with the user's key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the user is not blocked before reaching the maximum number of attempts. The expected result is false because the user has not yet reached the maximum limit. This test ensures that users are given enough attempts before being blocked.
Scenario 3: Test to verify if the user is unblocked after a successful reCaptcha
Details:
  TestName: testIsUserUnblockedAfterSuccessfulReCaptcha
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user is unblocked after a successful reCaptcha. We simulate a scenario where a user fails the reCaptcha until reaching the maximum limit and then succeeds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a key for a user, fail the reCaptcha for that key MAX_ATTEMPT times, and then succeed.
  Act: Invoke the isBlocked method with the user's key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the user is unblocked after a successful reCaptcha. The expected result is false because the user has succeeded the reCaptcha, resetting the attempt count. This test ensures that users are unblocked after successful reCaptcha.

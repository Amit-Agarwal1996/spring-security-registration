"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the number of failed attempts increases after calling the reCaptchaFailed method.

Details:
  TestName: testIncrementInFailedAttempts.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'reCaptchaFailed' method correctly increments the number of failed attempts in the 'attemptsCache'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock key and get the initial number of failed attempts from 'attemptsCache'.
    Act: Invoke the 'reCaptchaFailed' method with the mock key.
    Assert: Assert that the number of failed attempts in 'attemptsCache' for the mock key has increased by one.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'reCaptchaFailed' method correctly increments the number of failed attempts in 'attemptsCache'. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the reCAPTCHA system as it determines when a user gets blocked due to too many failed attempts.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the 'reCaptchaFailed' method correctly handles non-existent keys.

Details:
  TestName: testHandlingOfNonExistentKeys.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'reCaptchaFailed' method correctly handles non-existent keys in the 'attemptsCache'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock key that does not exist in the 'attemptsCache'.
    Act: Invoke the 'reCaptchaFailed' method with the non-existent key.
    Assert: Assert that the number of failed attempts in 'attemptsCache' for the non-existent key is one.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'reCaptchaFailed' method correctly handles non-existent keys in the 'attemptsCache' by initializing the number of failed attempts to one. This is important as it ensures that all keys, even non-existent ones, are treated consistently by the system.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the 'reCaptchaFailed' method does not affect successful attempts.

Details:
  TestName: testNoEffectOnSuccessfulAttempts.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'reCaptchaFailed' method does not affect successful attempts.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock key and invoke the 'reCaptchaSucceeded' method with the mock key.
    Act: Invoke the 'reCaptchaFailed' method with the mock key.
    Assert: Assert that the number of failed attempts in 'attemptsCache' for the mock key is one and the successful attempt is invalidated.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'reCaptchaFailed' method does not affect successful attempts. This is crucial as it ensures that successful and failed attempts are treated separately by the system.

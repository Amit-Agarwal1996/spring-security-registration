Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct score is returned by the getScore method
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectScoreReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check if the correct score value is returned when the getScore method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GoogleResponse object and set a score using setScore method.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method on the GoogleResponse object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned score matches the score that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method correctly returns the score that was set. This is important for the correct functioning of the application as the score is used in various calculations and decisions.
Scenario 2: Test to verify that the default score is returned when a score is not set
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultScoreReturnedWhenScoreNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the default score is returned when the getScore method is called and a score has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GoogleResponse object without setting a score.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method on the GoogleResponse object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the default score is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method returns the default score when a score has not been set. This is important for the correct functioning of the application as it ensures that a score is always available, even if one has not been explicitly set.
Scenario 3: Test to verify that the getScore method returns a float value
Details:
  TestName: testGetScoreReturnsFloat
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getScore method returns a float value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GoogleResponse object and set a score using setScore method.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method on the GoogleResponse object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is of type float.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method returns a float value. This is important for the correct functioning of the application as the score is used in various calculations and decisions, which require it to be a float.
